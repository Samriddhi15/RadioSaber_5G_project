## 📜 Project Overview  

RadioSaber is a cutting-edge **5G RAN slicing algorithm** designed to achieve:  
1. **High spectrum efficiency**.  
2. **Weighted fairness** among slices according to their Service Level Agreements (SLAs).  
3. Support for **customizable scheduling policies** for slices.  

For in-depth details, refer to our paper published in **NSDI'2023**.

## 🔍 Overview of RadioSaber  

RadioSaber is based on **LTE-Sim**, an open-source framework for simulating Radio Access Networks (RAN) in LTE. LTE-Sim supports:  

- PDCP, RLC, MAC, and RRC layers.  
- Physical layer channel propagation models.  
- Applications with diverse **QoS requirements**.  
- User mobility scenarios.  

### ✨ Key Features:  
- **100 MHz downlink bandwidth** for cells.  
- Resource allocation at the **Resource Block Group (RBG)** level.  
- Support for **subband CQI report mechanisms**.  
- Use of **real channel quality traces** from Software Defined Radios (SDR).  

The primary focus of RadioSaber is on **flow scheduling** in the MAC layer.

## ⚙️ Software Installation  

RadioSaber is tested in an **Ubuntu environment**.  

### Prerequisites:  
Install the required library:  
```bash  
sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev  

sudo apt-get install libjsoncpp-dev
## How to Run RadioSaber  

## How to run RadioSaber
Since RadioSaber is built upon LTE-Sim, there is a lot legacy code we won't use. After you've built RadioSaber, run the following command to start an experiment:

```
${PATH-TO-RADIOSABER}/LTE-Sim SingleCellWithI [radius] [inter-slice scheduler] [frame struct] [mobility speed] [random seed] [config file]
```

Parameters:

* radius: the radius of the coverage area of a cell, the default value is 1
* inter-slice scheduler:
  * 1: No-Slicing, a global proportional fairness scheduler without any notion of slicing
  * 7: NVS, a channel-agnostic inter-slice scheduler proposed in [Mobicom10](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1859995.1860023)
  * 8: Sequential, a channel-aware inter-slice scheduler that has lower time complexity and lower spectrum efficiency
  * 9: RadioSaber, our channel-aware inter-slice scheduler
  * 10: Upperbound, an impractical scheme that offers an upper-bound on the spectrum efficiency that any inter-slice scheduler can achieve
  * 11: NVS-Nongreedy, the inter-slice scheduler applies NVS while enterprise schedulers apply a non-greedy proportional fairness algorithm proposed by [Mobicom18](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3241539.3241552)
* frame struct: the cellular applies FDD or TDD. It must be set to 1 to apply FDD
* mobility speed: the mobility speed of UEs. If the simulator uses collected CQI traces instead of simulating the channel quality, then it doesn't matter.
* random seed: random seed
* config file: a JSON-based configuration file

Config File:

The config file is in JSON file format. It configures the scheduling algorithm, number of UEs, the weight of every slice, and how UEs in every slice instantiate applications and flows.

## Experiments and Reproducibility
### Spectrum Efficiency and Fairness(Sec 6.1):
* Change the working directory: ```cd ${PATH-TO-RADIOSABER}/NSDI23-radiosaber-experiments/exp-customization```, and run this experiment with ```./run_backlogged.sh```

* For slices with the same weights, the config file is: ```./exp-backlogged-20slicesdiffw/config.json```
For slices with different weights, the config file is: ```./exp-backlogged-20slicesdiffw/config ```

* After experiments finish, run ```./plot_throughput.py``` to get the throughput and radio resource distribution graph
